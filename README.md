# Overview

**Introducing ZChains**

An interoperable L1 network driven by its ecosystem and focused in delivering experience-based services. ZChains is a modular and extensible framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, sidechains, and general scaling solutions.

Its primary use is to bootstrap a new blockchain network while providing full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and transactions. It uses IBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant) consensus mechanism, supported in one flavour as [PoS (proof of stake)](https://zchains.gitbook.io/zchains-whitepaper/consensus/pos-stake-unstake).

ZChains also supports communication with multiple blockchain networks, enabling transfers of both [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) and [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721) tokens, by utilising the centralised bridge solution.

Industry standard wallets can be used to interact with ZChains through the [JSON-RPC](https://zchains.gitbook.io/zchains-whitepaper/architecture/modules/json-rpc) endpoints and node operators can perform various actions on the nodes through the [gRPC](https://zchains.gitbook.io/zchains-whitepaper/working-with-node/query-operator-info) protocol.
